        Maven
        How to run tests in parallel

        ####################################################

    How web application works?

    Source Code --> compile --> unit tests --> .jar

    What is application server?
    - Program that runs web application and makes it available for user via browser. For example Tomcat, JBoss, Jetty,
    etc.

    Maven is a project build tool.

    But maven, is not only one build tool for java, there is also Ant and Gradle.

    Deployment:
        is a process of delivering new version of software to the application server.

    Release:
        it's a process of delivering new version of software to the end-user.

    Maven helps us to automate all processes starting from compiling project and till deployment.

    web service:
        it's an application, that process some data and works through web.

    Application server:
        it's a software that hosts web service.

    Also, maven responsible for dependencies.
    dependencies helps us to easily add libraries and be independent from IDE.

    IDE :
        eclipse, Intellij, Netbeans

    Maven, makes our project independent from IDE. We can run tests without IDE.

    Maven default lifecycles:

    ❏ validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    ❏ compile - compile the source code of the project
    ❏ test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing
    framework
    ❏ verify - run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality
    criteria

    clean - remove all files generated by the previous build

    install - copy .jar file to local maven repository
    deploy - send it to remote repository

    mvn verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @driver_with_data_table"

    or

    mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @driver_with_data_table"

    -Dcucumber.options="--tags @sometag" - provide scenarios that you want to run. No need to change CucumberRunner class.

    It overrides runner class configuration.

    If you see at the end BUILD SUCCESS

    That means all maven goals were executed and project is ready to use.

    If CucumberRunner didn't fail, there is nothing to execute for FailedRunner. But, the problem is that they share
    reports. Thus, cucumber.json file will be overridden by FailedRunner and it will be empty.


    mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @driver_with_data_table" - run tests with @driver_with_data_table tag

    clear - to clear terminal
